# Starbucks Promotion Optimization Project

This project is a data science portfolio exercise that simulates a Starbucks promotional campaign. The goal is to build a machine learning model that determines which customers should receive a promotion to maximize revenue and customer engagement, while minimizing unnecessary marketing costs.

## Project Overview

In this project, we are given data from an advertising promotion run by Starbucks to see whether offering a promotion increases customer purchases of a specific product. The data consists of 120,000 customer data points, split into training and test datasets. Each customer has abstract features (V1-V7) and a promotion history, along with whether they purchased the product.

We aim to maximize two metrics:
1. **Incremental Response Rate (IRR)**: Measures how many additional customers purchased due to receiving the promotion.
2. **Net Incremental Revenue (NIR)**: Measures the additional revenue generated after subtracting promotion costs.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two main files:
- **training.csv**: Contains customer data and their purchase decisions for training the model.
- **test.csv**: Contains customer data for testing the model's performance.

Each record includes:
- `Promotion`: Indicates whether the customer received a promotion (Yes/No).
- `purchase`: Indicates whether the customer made a purchase (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
- `V1-V7`: Abstract features associated with each customer.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Checked for missing values and ensured the dataset was in a usable format.
    - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between features and target variables.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Created new features from the existing dataset to help the model better understand patterns.
  
3. **Model Building**:
    - Trained various machine learning models to predict the impact of promotions on customer purchases.
    - Models included logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.

4. **Optimization**:
    - Optimized models to maximize the **Incremental Response Rate (IRR)** and **Net Incremental Revenue (NIR)**.
  
5. **Evaluation**:
    - Evaluated the performance of models on the test dataset using the IRR and NIR metrics.

## Results

The final model demonstrated significant improvement in targeting customers who are more likely to respond to promotions, thereby increasing Starbucks' potential revenue while keeping promotional costs in check.
